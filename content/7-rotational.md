## Radians

**Definition:** An angle in radians is defined as $\frac{l}{r}$, where $l$ is the arclength of the arc that some angle, $\theta$, subtends.

Using this definition, one full revolution is defined as $\rad{2\pi}$. This is because the circumference of a circle is $2\pi r$, for a radius, $r$. With cancellation of $r$, the quotient $\frac{l}{r}$ defining the angle in radians is rendered independent of the radius of the arc subtended, making it a valid angle measure.
